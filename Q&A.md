## Question 1

Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts: Records Indexing. I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers,  
George

Hi George,

Absolutely! Here’s a more colorful explanation using analogies.

**Records:** Think of records as individual books in a library. Each book contains specific information (like a story or data) that can be checked out and read. Just like each book has its own title and author, each record has its own unique data.

**Indexing:** Imagine indexing as creating a catalog for that library. Instead of searching through every book to find what you need, the catalog organizes the books by title, author, or genre. This way, you can quickly locate a book without sifting through the entire collection. Indexing does the same for data, making it easy to find relevant information quickly.

Examples of Custom Ranking Attributes: 
**Sales Rank:** Prioritizes items based on how well they sell.
**Stock Levels:** Ranks items based on availability.
**Ratings:** Uses customer ratings to influence visibility.
**Boolean Attributes:** Such as whether an item is on sale or offers free shipping.

I hope this make things clearer! Let me know if you have any more questions.

## Question 2

Hello,

Sorry to give you feedback that I know you may not want to hear, but I really dislike the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes now require several clicks, which is inconvenient for me while iterating.

Hi Matt,

Thank you for your feedback regarding the new dashboard design. We appreciate your honesty, as it helps us improve the user experience.

We understand that the recent changes, particularly around clearing and deleting indexes, may have added extra steps to your workflow. The redesign aimed to enhance navigation and accessibility for all users, including those who may not be as technical. However, we recognize that this may have inadvertently made some tasks more cumbersome for experienced users like yourself.

Your input is valuable, and we will take it into consideration as we continue to refine the dashboard. If you have any specific suggestions on how we can make these processes more efficient, please feel free to share.

Thanks again for reaching out!

Best regards,

Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia into my website. Will this require a lot of development work? What does the high-level process look like?

Hi Leo,

Thanks for reaching out! The complexity of implementation can vary, but it can often be quite straightforward—sometimes just requiring a few clicks and importing some predefined libraries.

I recommend starting with this quick 1-minute video that outlines how simple implementation can be in just three steps:

Algolia offers integrations with over 40 popular web and mobile technologies:

We also provide InstantSearch libraries that come with ready-made UI components for various frameworks including vanilla JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, Android, and iOS.

If your integration is more complex than that, I'm here to help make the process as smooth as possible. Could you share what your current tech stack looks like? This way, I can tailor my suggestions specifically for your setup.

Alternatively, if you'd prefer real-time discussion, feel free to book some time on my calendar:

Looking forward to hearing from you!
